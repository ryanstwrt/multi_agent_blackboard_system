# Multi-Agent Blackboard System

The multi-agent blackboard system (MABS) is a general use blackboard framework, which employs the use of multiple agents.
Multiple agents are allowed to exist and operate concurrently using osBrain [1].
The MABS has a skeletal framework that introduces the basic components for the blackboard and knowledge agents.
Users can leverage these components and build a blackboard system which is able to accommodate their needs.

This repository is currently under construction. 
Check back for more information when the final framework is ready.
