    "# Building a Blackboard System\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by initializing our multi-agent system using osBrain [1].\n",
    "For the basic program, three agents will be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Agent 1: Blackboard\n",
    "* Agent 2: Knowledge Agent - Reactor Physics (ka-rp)\n",
    "* Agent 3: Knowledge Agent - Blackboard Reader (ka-br)\n",
    "\n",
    "The blackboard agent will retain all of the results obtained by the neutronics agent on the second abstract level of the blackboard (`level 2`).\n",
    "`level 2` contains raw data in the form of a nested dictionary. \n",
    "This data consists of the design variables (height, smear, and plutonium fraction) and objectives (keff, void coefficient, Doppler coefficient, plutonium fraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ka-rp` simulates a reactor core using a surrogate model, where the design variables are used to predict a set of objective functions.\n",
    "The design variables are selected randomly between the minimum and maximum values that are used in the surrogate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ka-br` examines `level 2` of the blackboard to determine if all of the objective variables are within some desired range.\n",
    "If the `ka-br` finds a core which meets the objective functions, it will place the core name on the first level of the blackboard (`level 1`).\n",
    "This will trigger the end of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "We start off by simply initializing the blackboard and neutronics KA.\n",
    "Both agents are initialized using the `connect_agent` function.\n",
    "This connects each agent to the blackboard and connects the three different types of communication that are required to interact with the blackboard.\n",
    "The blackboard is the only agent that knowledge agents interact with.\n",
    "KA never talk with other KA, and only pass information to each other by writing to the blackboard. \n",
    "This ia a fundamental property of blackboard systems, even in a multi-agent environment.\n",
    "Three channels of communication are used in the blackboard system: writer, trigger, and execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The writer channel is a request-reply communication channel, which allows the KA to continually request if the blackboard is currently being written to.\n",
    "If it is, the blackboard informs the KA that another KA is writing and that it will have to wait.\n",
    "The KA will then wait for a second and request the state of the blackboard again, until it is able to write its information.\n",
    "For the traditional blackboard, only one knowledge agent is active at a time, and as such it should never encounter a situation where it will be denied access to the blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trigger channel contains two communication channels, a publish-subscribe channel and a push-pull channel.\n",
    "The blackboard initiates the publish-subscribe channel which allows the blackboard publish to trigger event.\n",
    "The trigger event is used to determine which KA will be selected for execution in the next step.\n",
    "The KAs initiate the push-pull channel, which allows them respond to the trigger publication with their associated trigger value.\n",
    "Trigger values will change for some KAs depending on how the problem is progressing.\n",
    "For the traditional blackboard scheme, the trigger value for the neutroncis knowledge agent will always be 1.0, and the blackboard level 2 synthesizer's trigger value will oscillate between 0 and 2 every 10 evaluations to periodically check the blackboard for a good solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execute channel is a push-pull channel, where the blackboard will inform a KA that they have been selected for execution.\n",
    "We then enter a while loop until the KA has finished their action for the traditional blackboard system.\n",
    "Otherwise, the blackboard could continue on with the process and send another trigger event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the communication channels, we set a couple of desired variables for our KAs.\n",
    "For the `ka-rp` agent no attributes are set, however for the `ka-br`, we set the ranges for our objective functions.\n",
    "These ranges will determine how fast the solution will be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the blackboard, the entry type for each abstract level is required to be set.\n",
    "`level 1` requires that the dictionary entry have a key labed `valid`, where the value takes on a `bool` data type.\n",
    "Similarly, `level 1` requires a `reactor parameters` key, where the values itself a dictionary.\n",
    "The nested dictionary for `reactor parameters` has keys for all of the design variables and objective functions, where each value is simply a `float` data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that each KA has the correct format for adding to the blackboard.\n",
    "If the keys or datatypes for each entry are not correct, the entry will not be added to the blackboard."

    "\n",
    "The previous two aspects have shown off the blackboard and its interactions with the two types of knowledge agents, but from the outside, the knowledge agents act like a black-box; we tell the agent to run and it returns some value to the blackboard.\n",
    "The glean a better understanding of the blackboard system as a whole, an more in-depth discussion of the knowledge agents inner workings is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neutronics (Reactor Physics) Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The neutronics agent (`ka_rp`) performs three steps when it is executed: run Dakota, read Dakota results, and write results to the blackboard.\n",
    "Running Dakota initiates a single-objective optimization scheme using a genetic algorithm (SOGA) [2].\n",
    "For each SOGA, Dakota attempts to create an optimized core by adjusting the design variables: fuel height, smear, and plutonium fraction.\n",
    "An optimized core is dependent on the three objective functions: k-eigenvalue, sodium void coefficent, and Doppler coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each objective funcion, an associated weight is required.\n",
    "These weights are initially found using random number generator, which assigns a weight between 0 and 1 for each objective.\n",
    "Once a set number of simulations have been run, a surrogate model is used to calculate the objective weights.\n",
    "This is performed using an in-house surrogate model generator wrapped around the `scikit-learn` module [3].\n",
    "A desired solutions is known (see next section), and the surrogate model predicts what weights would yield that solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dakota optimization scheme also uses a surrogate model to determine how the design variables affect the objective functions.\n",
    "This is used in place of a full MCNP calculation [4].\n",
    "The surrogate model uses a database to perform an interpolation between the known values present in the database, and the values Dakota requires.\n",
    "The module `train_surrogate_models` is used as the surrogate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of an optimization scheme, the `ka_rp` reads the Dakota associated H5 file [5].\n",
    "This file contains all the values for each design variable and objective function for the optimal core, based on the weighting scheme.\n",
    "These results are read in by the `ka_rp` and converted to a Pandas dataframe [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step for the `ka_rp` is to write the results for the optimal core configuration to the blackboard on the third level of abstraction (`lvl_3`), where raw reactor physics data is kept.\n",
    "This creates an entry containing the core name and the Pandas dataframe containing all of the design and objective variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Blackboard Level 2 Synthesizer Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The blackboard level 2 synthesizer agent (`ka_lvl2`) reads the blackboard and examines each of the solutions to determine if any solution is within some percent of the desired solution.\n",
    "The desired solutions is based on utilizing physical programming in place of a weighting scheme for the SOGA [7]. \n",
    "The solutions should have the following objective function values:\n",
    "\n",
    "* k-eigenvalue: 1.0303\n",
    "* Void Coefficient: -110.023\n",
    "* Doppler Coefficient: -0.6926\n",
    "* Pu Fraction: 54.75\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ka_lvl2` agent find the percent difference between each objective and sums these values. \n",
    "If the resulting sum is less than the `ind_err` set for `ka_lvl2` then it gets placed in abstract level 2 of the blackboard (`lvl_2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Blackboard Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The blackboard is unique agent which holds the all of the information obtained by the `ka_rp` agent, and information that has been updated by `ka_lvl2`.\n",
    "This information is stored in two separate abstract levels as hinted at in the previous sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract level 3 (`lvl_3`) contains data from the `ka_rp` in the form of a dictionary, whose keys are the core name (in the form of `Core_(weights)`).\n",
    "The value for each dictionary is a nested dictionary with the keys for the reactor parameters (`rx_parameters`) and the cross-section set used (`xs_set`).\n",
    "The cross-section set is currently not used for this analysis, but will be used in future research.\n",
    "The `rx_parameters` entry contains a pandas dataframe consisting of various reactor data information including all of the design and objective variables along with the weights associated with each objective variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract level 2 (`lvl_2`) stores core designs that meet the error requirements set up by `ka_lvl2`."
