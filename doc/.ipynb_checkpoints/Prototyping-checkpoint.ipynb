    "# Building a Blackboard System\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by initializing our multi-agent system using osBrain [1].\n",
    "For the basic program, three agents will be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Agent 1: Blackboard\n",
    "* Agent 2: Knowledge Agent - Neutronics\n",
    "* Agent 3: Knowledge Agent - Blackboard Level 2 Synthesizer\n",
    "\n",
    "The blackboard agent will retain all of the optimization results obtained by the neutronics agent on the third level of the blackboard.\n",
    "Abstract level 3 contains raw data in the form of Pandas Dataframe. \n",
    "This data consists of the design variables (height, smear, and plutonium fraction), objectives (keff, void coefficient, doppler coefficient, plutonium fraction), and the weights for each objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neutronics knowledge agent (KA) will run a neutronics optimization for a given set of objective weights.\n",
    "For the traditional blackboard system, as seen here, we use a proxy neutronics KA, which as features uniques to performing sodium fast reactor optimization.\n",
    "This is performed using Dakota as the optimization engine, and a surrogate model to obtain the reactor paramters (i.e. our objective functions).\n",
    "Once an optimal solution has been determined, the neutronics KA writes the associated design variables, objective functions, and weights to the blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Blackboard Level 2 Synthesizer KA examines abstract level 3 of the blackboard to determine if solutions are close to the desired solution.\n",
    "A proxy is also used for the Blackboard Level 2 Synthesizer, as the propertires associated with core design are slightly different compared with the full scale MABS.\n",
    "If a solution is within some percent of the desired solution, the Blackboard Level 2 Synthesizer KA will take basic information from abstract level 3 and place it in abstract level 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "We start off by simply initializing the blackboard and neutronics KA.\n",
    "Both agents are initialized using the `connect_agent` function.\n",
    "This connects each agent to the blackboard and connects the three different types of communication that are required to interact with the blackboard.\n",
    "The blackboard is the only agent that knowledge agents interact with.\n",
    "KA never talk with other KA, and only pass information to each other by writing to the blackboard. \n",
    "This ia a fundamental property of blackboard systems, even in a multi-agent environment.\n",
    "Three channels of communicationa are used in the blackboard system: writer, triger, and excecute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The writer channel is a request-reply communication channel, which allows the KA to continually request if the blackboard is currently being written to.\n",
    "If it is, the blackboard informs the KA that another KA is writing and that it will have to wait.\n",
    "The KA will then wait for a second and request the state of the blackboard again, until it is able to write its information.\n",
    "For the traditional blackboard, only one knowledge agent is active at a time, and as such it should never encounter a situation where it will be denied access to the blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trigger channel contains two communication channels, a publish-subscribe channel and a push-pull channel.\n",
    "The blackboard initiates the publish-subscribe channel which allows the blackboard publish to trigger event.\n",
    "The trigger event is used to determine which KA will be selected for execution in the next step.\n",
    "The KAs initiate the push-pull channel, which allows them respond to the trigger publication with their associated trigger value.\n",
    "Trigger values will change for some KAs depending on how the problem is progressing.\n",
    "For the traditional blackboard scheme, the trigger value for the neutroncis knowledge agent will always be 1.0, and the blackboard level 2 synthesizer's trigger value will oscilate between 0 and 2 every 10 evaluations to periodically check the blackboard for a good solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execute channel is a push-pull channel, where the blackboard will inform a KA that they have been selected for execution.\n",
    "We then enter a while loop until the KA has finished their action for the traditional blackboard system.\n",
    "Otherwise, the blackboard could continue on with the process and send another tirgger event."

    "The blackboard level 2 synthesizer agent (`ka_lvl2`) reads the blackboard and examines each of the solutions to determine if any solution is within some percent of the desired solution.\n",

    "This information is stored in two separate abstract levels as hinted at in the previous sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract level 3 (`lvl_3`) contains data from the `ka_rp` in the form of a dictonary, whose keys are the core name (in the form of `Core_(weights)`).\n",

    "The cross-section set is currently not used for this analysis, but will be used in future research.\n",
    "The `rx_parameters` entry contains a pandas dataframe consisting of various reactor data information including all of the design and objective variables along with the weights associated with each objective variable.\n",
